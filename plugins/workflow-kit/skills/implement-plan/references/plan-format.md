# Plan Format Reference

Referenced from `SKILL.md` Steps 1 and 4. The plan file must use this structure for the
prep sub-agent to parse it and for the skill to track phases correctly.

## Required Structure

Phases are `###` sections with checkbox task lines (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`). A plan lacking this
structure causes the prep agent to return a structure error instead of an extract.

## Annotated Example

```markdown

## Tests
- FavoritesUseCaseTest: ≥80% coverage
- FavoritesRepositoryImplTest: ≥80% coverage
